## üé® Customization

### Quick Customizations

Want to customize the map for your needs? Here are the most common modifications:

**Adding New Colors**: See [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md#adding-new-colors) for instructions on extending the color palette.

**Using Your Own Map**: The application can be adapted to work with any SVG-based map. See [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md#adding-new-map-types) for technical details.

**Styling Changes**: Modify colors, fonts, and layout through the CSS files in the `src/` directory.

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Map not loading**: Ensure all dependencies are installed with `npm install`
2. **Export not working**: Check browser permissions for file downloads
3. **Clipboard operations failing**: Ensure you're using HTTPS or localhost
4. **Zoom feels off**: Use Shift + scroll wheel for zoom (known issue: may appear slightly diagonal)
5. **Performance on large maps**: Consider reducing zoom level or using fewer simultaneous selections

For technical troubleshooting and development issues, see [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md#debugging-tips).

### Browser Compatibility

- Chrome/Edge: Full support
- Firefox: Full support
- Safari: Full support (clipboard operations require user interaction)
